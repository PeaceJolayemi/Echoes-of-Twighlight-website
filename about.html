    <h1>A Story About What We Remember</h1>

    <p>
      In a world where memories fade like twilight, you play as Aria, a young woman who discovers she has the power to enter other people's fading memories. But every memory she saves comes at a cost—her own memories begin to slip away.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We designed this story to be experienced slowly, with real consequences instead of flashy promises. Every choice matters, and the game respects your time by focusing on meaningful character development rather than filler content.
    </p>
